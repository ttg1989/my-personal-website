                <p>I have been programming video games in the Unity Engine for about a year now. I learned to do this mostly using
                video tutorials on <a href="https://www.youtube.com" title="YouTube">YouTube</a>. Being self-taught can be challenging
                at times but it is very rewarding also. I have programmed a total of two video games in Unity. One game is finished, while
                the other game is currently under development. I am hoping to get the alpha of the second video game out in November or December.</p>
